Welcome!!!

This mini project displays some react components, it consists of routing, React Hooks like useContext, useState, useNavigate, useParams, useEffect, uuid.

Currently, it is not mobile responsive it only displays use of libraries and building functional components with minimal styling.

In this I have created home page to display what is built in the web app.
